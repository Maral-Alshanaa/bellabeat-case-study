# Bellabeat Leaf — Smart Device Usage Analysis

> Google Data Analytics Certificate | Capstone Case Study  
> **Tools:** Python · pandas · matplotlib · seaborn · Tableau  
> **Dataset:** FitBit Fitness Tracker Data (Kaggle/Möbius, CC0)

---

## Project Summary

Analyzed FitBit smart device usage data from 35 users across two 
time periods (March–May 2016) to identify behavioral trends in daily 
activity, sleep, and sedentary patterns. Applied those insights to 
**Bellabeat's Leaf** wellness tracker to produce three data-driven 
marketing recommendations.

**Key findings:**
- Users spend **80.6% of their day sedentary** (avg 990 min/day)
- Average daily steps are **7,328** — 27% below the CDC 10,000-step target
- Only **20% of users** (7 of 35) consistently hit 10,000 steps/day
- Users average **39 minutes awake in bed** per night despite 7 hrs sleep
- **Saturday** is the most active day, **Sunday** the least active
- Peak activity windows occur at **12–1pm** and **5–7pm** daily

## Key Findings

| # | Finding | Leaf Implication |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Saturday most active, Sunday least (1,190 step gap) | Target Sunday and Friday for app challenges |
| 2 | Activity peaks at 12–1pm and 5–7pm daily | Schedule reminders at 10:30am and 4pm |
| 3 | 39 min awake in bed per night on average | Campaign on sleep quality gap |
| 4 | 80.6% of day spent sedentary | Market Leaf's inactivity alerts as hero feature |
| 5 | 52% of users are Sedentary or Low Active | Target aspirational moderate exercisers |
| 6 | Weak correlation between steps and sleep duration | Focus on holistic tracking story |

## The 3 Leaf Marketing Recommendations

**1. Position Leaf as the antidote to invisible inactivity**  
Users spend 80.6% of their day sedentary without realising it.  
Campaign angle: *"You sat for 3 hours without noticing. Leaf noticed."*

**2. Time Leaf notifications around users' natural activity peaks**  
Pre-peak reminders at 10:30am and 4pm amplify existing habits.  
Campaign angle: *"Leaf works with your rhythm, not against it."*

**3. Lead with sleep quality, not just sleep duration**  
Users spend 39 min awake in bed despite adequate hours in bed.  
Campaign angle: *"8 hours in bed doesn't mean 8 hours of rest. Leaf shows you the difference."*

## Data Limitations

- 35 users — too small for statistical significance
- Data collected in 2016 — usage patterns have evolved
- No demographic data — gender, age, location unconfirmed
- Weight log covers only 13 users — excluded from main analysis
- Sleep data only available for 24 of 35 users
